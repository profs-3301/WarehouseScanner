# Product Overview: WarehouseScanner
## Mobile application for Android OS, used to scan bar code on products
Using a special smartphone, we can scan the barcodes of goods coming to the warehouse (when we read the barcode of the product, the barcode will indicate the size of the batch of goods that arrived), for ordinary mobile devices you can enter the code manually. This program is designed to simplify the distribution and keeping track of goods in 14 stores by IF during the daily sorting and delivery of goods to stores.
